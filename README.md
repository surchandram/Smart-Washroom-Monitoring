**Project Summary: IoT-Driven Washroom Monitoring and Analytics System**

The IoT-based washroom monitoring and analytics system is a cutting-edge solution designed to enhance facility management through real-time insights into washroom usage. Built on the ThingsBoard platform and integrated with the ChirpStack network server, this system offers advanced monitoring, data visualization, and reporting across multiple washrooms within a facility. Key features include:

### 1. Real-Time Occupancy and Usage Monitoring:
- **Dynamic Occupancy Tracking:** Continuously monitors the number of individuals inside each washroom in real-time.
- **Cubicle Status Visualization:** Graphically displays the status of cubicles (vacant/occupied).
- **Entry and Exit Counting:** Tracks people entering and exiting the washroom, ensuring accurate occupancy data.
- **Total People Inside:** Provides real-time graph and time-series data showing the total number of people inside the washroom.

### 2. Comprehensive Time-Based Analytics:
- **Predictive Wait Time Analytics:** Predicts and analyzes wait times, particularly when cubicles are nearly fully occupied, presented with graphs and time-series data.
- **Total Wait Time Calculation:** Automatically calculates total wait times, helping identify peak usage and bottlenecks.

### 3. Occupancy and Cubicle Monitoring:
- **Vacant and Occupied Cubicles:** Tracks and visualizes vacant and occupied cubicles with accompanying graphs and time-series data tables.
- **Occupied Cubicles and Total Visitors (24-Hours):** Monitors the number of occupied cubicles and visitors over the last 24 hours, resetting daily at 5:30 AM.

### 4. Environmental and Condition Monitoring:
- **Water Leakage Monitoring:** Logs water leakage incidents with a time-series data table.
- **Temperature and Humidity Monitoring:** Tracks temperature and humidity levels, visualized through graphs and time-series data.
- **Air Quality Monitoring:** Measures ammonia and sulphide levels, calculates air quality based on user guidelines, and presents the data in graphs and time-series tables.

### 5. Advanced Dashboard and Visualization:
- **Customizable Themes:** Offers light and dark theme options for a personalized experience.
- **Customizable Layouts for Mall Map and Washrooms:** Supports dynamic layouts reflecting the facilityâ€™s physical map.
- **Real-Time Display of Cubicle Status:** Graphical interface showing real-time occupied and vacant cubicles.
- **Widget for Alarms and Alerts:** Provides a real-time display for alarms and alerts related to occupancy, air quality, or leakage.

### 6. Data Reporting and Downloads:
- **Downloadable Data:** Enables users to download up to 30 days of data in formats such as xls, xlsx, and csv.
- **Dashboard and Graph Downloads:** Supports exporting dashboards and graphs in pdf, png, jpeg, and json formats for offline reporting.

### 7. Device Monitoring and Access:
- **Web and Mobile App Access:** Full monitoring available via web and mobile apps for seamless device and data oversight.

### 8. Data-Driven Decision Making:
- **Real-Time Data Visualization:** Provides immediate insights for informed decision-making.
- **Historical Data Analysis:** Collects long-term data to guide future resource planning and facility design.
- **Scalability and Flexibility:** Easily scales to accommodate additional washrooms and devices as needed.

### 9. Operational Efficiency and User Experience:
- **Improved User Satisfaction:** Optimizes washroom usage and reduces wait times, enhancing the user experience.
- **Enhanced Facility Management:** Actionable insights enable proactive maintenance and greater operational efficiency.
- **Multiple Admins and User Roles:** Supports multiple administrators, sub-admins, users, and customers for flexible management.

### 10. Alerting and Notification System:
- **Email and Web Alerts:** Sends real-time notifications via email and web dashboard for updates on occupancy, air quality, leakage, and other key metrics.

### 11. Device and Network Management:
- **Dedicated Network Server:** Simplifies IoT device onboarding and network management with the ChirpStack network server.

### 12. Optimized Washroom Cubicle Maintenance:
- **Maintenance Dashboard:** Provides real-time insights to optimize cubicle maintenance and ensure operational readiness.
